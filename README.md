polly
=====

A second cousin to [Textymous](https://github.com/trmml/Textymous), using Twitter DMs as well.

The concept behind polly is ease of messaging, and assimilating Twitter DMs with SMS. DM a certain account with two pieces of information (recipient and body) and the bot will text the body to the provided number.
